A restful API for returning champion and item stats for League of Legends.

To see it run, follow a few easy steps:

1. Make sure you've got mongodb installed and running (`sudo mongod`).
2. Run `python main.py` in the correct directory.
3. Go to [localhost/champions/add](http://localhost:8888/champions/add) to populate the database.
4. Hit [localhost/champions/show/ahri](http://localhost:8888/champions/show/ahri) (ahri is the only one coded for now)to see the fruits of your labor.

Please leave any feedback you've got so far!
