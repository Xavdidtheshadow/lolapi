apparently json doesn't like comments, so I need to fix a few of the basic items (sightstone, machete, etc)

there's a lot of hardcoding of rank 5 abilities right now, will need to change at some point. 

Gotta do something with cooldowns. will need to wait until the timeline is written, but it could be some sort of cooldown function that checks/keeps track/is called by canCast()

everything with energy is hard coded to 200. i'll worry about increasing it through runes and whatever later
